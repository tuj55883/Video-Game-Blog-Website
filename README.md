# Video Game Website
This is a website that is linked to a SQL database that contains a list of users. Allowing users to register, modify and delete their account through the website. All made with JavaScript and HTML for client-side code and Java for server-side code. The website also displays a list of games from the SQL server and each game is linked to a user from the user table. This was all a semester long school project.
